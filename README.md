# ZebraBridge
Android zebra bridge for React native.

Considerations:\
-RN app must support multi dex since this native module uses jar files which adds a big number of methods.\
-RN app must declare in the Manifest the permissions CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE in order to be able to discover printers on the network
